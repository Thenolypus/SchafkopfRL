# SchafkopftRL

Training a reinforcement learning agent to play the four player card game Schafkopfen. Uses an Actor-Critic Network and proximal policy optimization for training.

## Schafkopf Rules
Schafkopf is a traditional bavarian 4 player trick based card game with imperfect information. It has both competetive and cooperative game elements.

There are a lot of different variations (allowed game types, allowed doubling mechanisms, ...) and reward schemes. A good overview can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schafkopf
